# M2 Amiga Tutorial
Hello, friends!  This repo contains a number of Amiga tutorial programs in Modula-2.
These programs are more-or-less direct adaptations of the C programs listed in the
online [Amiga C Tutorial](http://www.pjhutchison.org/tutorial/amiga_c.html). That said,
whenever C and Modula-2 programming methodologies differ for a given program, I am
endeavouring to keep the code as close as possible to idiomatic Modula-2.

I have created these tutorial programs using M2AMIGA, whose final release was open source.
You can find more information about the build system at [M2AMIGA](https://www.m2amiga.claudio.ch/).
The binaries and the source code are also available for download free of charge at that link.
